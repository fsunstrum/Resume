abstract = {The human genome contains an unusually large number of processed pseudogenes. The fact that processed pseudogenes are roughly 33% more abundant in our X chromosome than in our autosomes suggests that this overabundance is the result of the fact that human oogenesis is much longer than that of non-mammalian species. Here, we analyze the origins of the processed pseudogenes found on the human Y chromosome to determine whether human spermatogenesis also contribute to this overabundance. Our results show that human processed pseudogenes not only retrotranspose to the Y chromosome, but are also produced by genes on the Y chromosome. Furthermore, the fact that X chromosomes are three times more abundant than Y chromosomes likely explains why the euchromatic density of processed pseudogenes is three times higher in the X chromosome than in the Y chromosome. The large number of processed pseudogenes found in our genome is therefore due to the low substrate specificity of the L1 reverse transcriptase responsible for the reverse transcription of germline mRNA molecules into processed pseudogenes, as well as the life-long production of both male and female gametes.}
